#+title: Submodule: MeetiClone with Bootstrap

* About
This is submodule of my studying notes which were released as a public project in order to show it as part of a bigger portfolio, in this submodule I portrait the Second website design I learned to create by following the tutorial in the Bootstrap course made by the Mexican programmer and designer Juan Pablo De la torre Valdez in Udemy.
+ Course Name: Boostrap 5 y SASS - La Guia practica - Crea 10 sitios

* Deployment
[[https://xandro2021.github.io/BootstrapMeetiClone/][Github Pages Link]]

* Interesting things learned in this Project
** Install dependencies for development
#+begin_src bash
npm i --save-dev bootstrap sass
#+end_src

** Use of * to avoid having to write custom.$primary
#+begin_src scss
@use '../custom' as *;

.header {
    background-color: $primary;
}
#+end_src

** Overwrite Bootstrap-colors
+ In _custom.scss is showed about how to simple modification like colors

** overwrite bootstrap mediaquerys
It is possible to overwrite the values, but you need to go into mixins and breakpoints folder to find the names that were given by bootstrap, then you can overwrite it
_header.scss shows a simple example
#+begin_src scss
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    padding-top: 10rem;
    padding-bottom: 10rem;
}
#+end_src

** When changing something in bootstrap always used the specific property to change instead of using the short css version
Example: instead of writting padding: 3rem 0, use padding-top: 3rem and padding-bottom:3rem
+ Sometimes, some bootstrap clases have a specific value for some of the directions, and I we used the short css rules to do the changes we will be overwriting some default bootstrap values that we were not taking into consideration
